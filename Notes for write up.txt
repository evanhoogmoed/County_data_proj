Economic Data
Unable to use api as there were none available for the year 2021
Used this site: https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/
Got population and average income 
had to use multiprocessing to get the information
Added logger for debugging
Alaska and Louisiana uses Borough and Parish instead of county
Used non standard characters for hyphens and apostrophes which were fun to trouble shoot
Some counties do not have county in the url so we have to fix that somehow

Party Data
